This set of schemas was used to validate 3MF test cases conform to the 3MF
specifications supported by this suite and to flag as errors any content 
from unsupported specifications. These schemas should NOT be considered an
normative reference for 3MF as they are more restrictive than the schemas in the
3MF specifications.

The root xsd file is "qli_3MF.XSD". Launching this root XSD in an application
like XMLSpy will provide you with a consolidated view of all the 3MF elements and 
attributes supported by this test suite.
